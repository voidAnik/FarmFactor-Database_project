# Farmfactor-Database_project
A website made for village farmer. Project made in DBMS course. The concept was there shouldnâ€™t be any third-party seller. Main seller can directly contact with the buyer. And every product will be available in a time-to-time bidding system where the best bidder can buy the product.
